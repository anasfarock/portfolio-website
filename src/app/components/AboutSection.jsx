          Hi, I&apos;m Anas Farooq, a Computer Science student currently pursuing my
          degree at SZABIST with a strong interest in technology, data science,
          and innovation. My journey in the tech world has been shaped by
          hands-on experiences through internships, including my roles as a
          Technical Intern at Techaccess Pakistan and Zayup Communication. These
          opportunities have allowed me to enhance my skills in IT
          infrastructure, system troubleshooting, and customer service, while
          also fueling my passion for solving complex problems. In addition to
          my technical background, I have a keen interest in data science, which
          I&apos;ve explored through my proficiency in Python and its applications in
          analyzing and interpreting data. With a strong foundation in
          programming, data structures, system administration, and now Python
          and data science, I am constantly seeking to grow and contribute to
          projects that blend my love for technology and data-driven solutions.
          I&apos;m always open to collaborating on exciting projects and exploring
          new opportunities to further my skills.

                      I am currently pursuing a Bachelor&apos;s degree in Computer
                      Science at SZABIST, where I am dedicated to developing a
                      strong and comprehensive foundation in key areas such as
                      software development, data structures, algorithms, and systems
                      design. My academic journey so far has been enriched with a
                      combination of theoretical learning and practical, hands-on
                      projects that have significantly sharpened my analytical
                      thinking, and problem-solving abilities. Through coursework
                      and team-based assignments, I have gained experience in
                      designing and implementing scalable software solutions, and
                      understanding how modern computing infrastructures work under
                      the hood. These experiences have not only enhanced my
                      technical skills but also helped me build soft skills like
                      teamwork, time management, and effective
                      communicationâ€”essential traits for tech industry.
